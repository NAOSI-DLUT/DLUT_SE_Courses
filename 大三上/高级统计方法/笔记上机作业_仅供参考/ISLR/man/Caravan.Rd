\description{The data contains 5822 real customer records. Each record
  consists of 86 variables, containing sociodemographic data (variables
  1-43) and product ownership (variables 44-86). The sociodemographic
  data is derived from zip codes. All customers living in areas with the
  same zip code have the same sociodemographic attributes. Variable 86
  (\code{Purchase}) indicates whether the customer purchased a caravan
  insurance policy. Further information on the individual variables can
  be obtained at  http://www.liacs.nl/~putten/library/cc2000/data.html
