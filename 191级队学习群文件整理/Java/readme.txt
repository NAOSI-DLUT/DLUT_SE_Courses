I suggested to my brother Todd, who is making the leap from hardware into programming, 
that the next big revolution will be in genetic engineering. We'll have microbes designed to
make food, fuel and plastic; they'll clean up pollution and in general allow us to master the
manipulation of the physical world for a fraction of what it costs now. I claimed that it would
make the computer revolution look small in comparison. Then I realized I was making a
mistake common to science fiction writers: getting lost in the technology (which is of course
easy to do in science fiction). An experienced writer knows that the story is never about the
things; it's about the people. Genetics will have a very large impact on our lives, but I'm not
so sure it will dwarf the computer revolution - or at least the information revolution.
Information is about talking to each other: yes, cars and shoes and especially genetic cures
are important, but in the end those are just trappings. What truly matters is how we relate to
the world. And so much of that is about communication. This book is a case in point. A
majority of folks thought I was very bold or a little crazy to put the entire thing up on the
Web. "Why would anyone buy it " they asked. If I had been of a more conservative nature I
wouldn't have done it, but I really didn't want to write another computer book in the same
old way. I didn't know what would happen but it turned out to be the smartest thing I've ever
done with a book. For one thing, people started sending in corrections. This has been an
amazing process, because folks have looked into every nook and cranny and caught both
technical and grammatical errors, and I've been able to eliminate bugs of all sorts that I know
would have otherwise slipped through.
